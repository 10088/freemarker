FreeMarker subcomponents with different copyright owners
--------------------------------------------------------

FreeMarker, both in its source code and binary form (freemarker.jar)
includes a number of files that are licensed by the Apache Software
Foundation under the Apache License, Version 2.0. This is the same
license as the license of FreeMaker, but the copyright owner is the
Apache Software Foundation. These files are:
  
    freemarker/ext/jsp/web-app_2_2.dtd

The "icomoon" font files (icomoon.eot, icomoon.svg, icomoon.ttf, and
icomoon.woff) under the "documentation" directory of the Freemarker
distribution are generated from Entypo pictograms, version 2.0, by

nor are they included in freemarker.jar.

    

Historical notes
----------------

FreeMarker 1.x was released under the LGPL license. Later, by
community consensus, we have switched over to a BSD-style license. As
of FreeMarker 2.2pre1, the original author, Benjamin Geer, has
relinquished the copyright in behalf of Visigoth Software Society.

With FreeMarker 2.3.21 the license has changed to Apache License,
Version 2.0, and the owner has changed from Visigoth Software Society
to three of the FreeMarker 2.x developers, Attila Szegedi, Daniel
Dekany, and Jonathan Revusky.
