This is the (draft) of the 2.4.0 change log so far. It's not in the Manual yet, as merging in XDocBook XML
changes from the 2.3 branch would be rather difficult.

- [NBC] Removed deprecated:
  Template#Template(String name, TemplateElement root, Configuration cfg) // package visible
- [NBC] Removed TemplateObject.getTemplate()
- [NBC] When resolving  arithmetic expressions and comparisons on parsing time (happens when only literal operands
  are involved), Template.getArithmeticEngine() isn't used any more. Configuration.getArithmeticEngine() is
  used instead.
- [NBC] FMParser constructors aren't public any more (and were changed).
- Added Environment.getCurrentTemplate()
- There are no separate org.freemarker:freemarker-gae and org.freemarker:freemarker artifacts anymore.
  There's only org.freemarker:freemarker, which is backward compatible.
- Custom attributes now keep the order of adding them
- [NBC] Removed command-line tools (main methods in a library, often classified as CWE-489 "Leftover Debug Code"):
  - freemarker.core.CommandLine (jar main-class) class.
  - freemarker.ext.dom.Transform class
  - freemarker.template.utility.ToCanonical class
  - freemarker.ext.jdom.NodeListModel.main() method
- Bugfix: When the same template was both #include-d and #import-ed, the macros from the #import-ed template has
  ran in the namespace of the #import-ed template.
- TemplateLoader.getLastModified(Object templateSource) can now throw GetLastModifiedException to indicate an
  error instead of returning -1 (which doesn't count as an error).

When TemplateCache2 will be merged in:
- [NBC] In 2.3.x, a cached error was thrown as a plain IOException with the original (cached) exception as its cause exception.
  This is not possible starting from 2.4.x, because the cache doesn't hold reference to the cached exception any more,
  instead it only stores a String description of it (class name, message, and the same for each its cause exceptions). 
  The cached error will be throw as a CachedTemplateLoadingException (an IOException subclass), which contains the string
  description of the original exception in its getMessage() value.
