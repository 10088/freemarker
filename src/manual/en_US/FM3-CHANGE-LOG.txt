Because the Manual won't be updated for a good while, I will lead
the FreeMarer 3 changelog here:

- Increased version number to 3.0.0 (nightly aka. SNAPSHOT)
- Removed legacy extensions: rhyno, jython, xml (not to be confused with dom), jdom, ant.
- Removed JSP 2.0 support (2.1 is the minimum for now, but maybe it will be 2.2 and Servlet 3.0 later).
- Removed freemarker.ext.log, our log abstraction layer from the old times when there was no clear winner on this field.
  Added org.slf4j:slf4j-api as required dependency instead.
